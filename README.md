 **Box Layout**
 
This repository demonstrates a simple webpage layout featuring various styled boxes using HTML and CSS. The layout uses Flexbox for responsive design and applies various visual styling techniques such as borders, shadows, and border-radius for a polished and visually appealing look.

üõ†Ô∏è **Project Structure**

index.html: Defines the structure of the webpage.
style.css: Contains all the styling rules for the boxes and layout.

üß± **HTML Structure**

The HTML file includes several div containers labeled "BOX A", "BOX B", etc., demonstrating different styles and layout positioning.

üé® **CSS Styling**

The CSS file defines the appearance of each box. Flexbox is used to create a responsive layout, and properties like padding, border radius, and box-shadow enhance the visual appeal.

**Key Styling Elements**:

Borders: Each box has a unique border and background color.
Shadows: Box shadows are used to create a subtle 3D effect.
Border Radius: Different values provide rounded corners for a softer look.
Flexbox Layout: Flexbox organizes the boxes inside .box-c and .box-g.
